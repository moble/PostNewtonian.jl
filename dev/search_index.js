The expressions through 3.5pN here come from Eq. (233) of Blanchet (2014).\n\nThe 4pN term from Eq. (5.2d) of Jaranowski and Schäfer is known exactly, now that the ν-linear piece is given as Eq. (32) of Bini and Damour (2013a).  The remaining terms are not known exactly, but Bini and Damour (2013b) have derived some terms, though there is incomplete information, which are noted as the constants in the following cell.  Note that, though the notation is confusing, Bini and Damour claim they did not calculate the coefficient they call a_6^ln 1; but it seems to be given in their Eq. (64).\n\nThe spin-squared terms (by which I mean both spin-spin and spin-orbit squared terms) in the energy are known only at 2pN order (from Kidder (1995) and Will and Wiseman (1996)).  They are most conveniently given in Eq. (C4) of Arun et al.\n\nThe spin-orbit terms in the energy are now complete to 4.0pN (the last term is zero).  These terms come from Eq. (4.6) of Bohé et al.

These apply to general — possibly precessing — non-eccentric binaries.  This collection of terms comes from Alvi (2001).  It probably wouldn't be too hard to extend Alvi's analysis to eccentric systems.\n\nNote that the validity of the result depends not only on the PN parameter v, but also on that angles of the spins relative to the separation vector n: the smaller the angle, the lower the v at which the approximations should be expected to break down.\n\nSee also\n\nTagoshi and Sasaki (1994)\nPoisson and Sasaki (1995)\nTagoshi et al.

Note that a true value here is critical if the dtmin_terminator callback is to have any effect.\n\nAll remaining keyword arguments are passed to the solve function of DiffEqBase.  See that function's documentation for details, including useful keyword arguments.  The most likely important ones are\n\nsaveat: Denotes specific times to save the solution at, during the solving phase.\ndt: Sets the initial stepsize. Defaults to an automatic choice if the method is adaptive.\ndtmax: Maximum dt for adaptive timestepping.\ndtmin: Minimum dt for adaptive timestepping.\n\nNote that if you want the solution to be output with specifically spaced time steps, you don't want dt, which is just the initial suggestion for adaptive systems; you want to set saveat to the desired spacing.  [The saveat argument could be a vector of specific times at which to save, but because we don't know when the PN evolution ends, this probably isn't useful.]\n\nAlso note that callback is already used by this function (in addition to the abstol and reltol mentioned above), which currently makes it impossible to modify the callbacks.  Hacking will be required to change that.  (Note: I think this may be easy, if we add the current callbacks to the problem, and just pass any input callbacks to solve.  I haven't tested it though.)\n\nInitial frequency vs. first frequency vs. end frequency\n\nNote the distinction between Ωᵢ (with subscript i) and Ω₁ (with subscript 1).  The first, Ωᵢ, represents the angular velocity of the initial condition from which the ODE integrator will begin; the second, Ω₁, represents the target angular velocity of the first element of the output data. That is, the ODE integration will run forwards in time from Ωᵢ to the merger, and then come back to Ωᵢ and run backwards in time to Ω₁.  The output data will stitch these two together to be one continuous (forwards-in-time) data series.\n\nFor example, if you are trying to match to a numerical relativity (NR) simulation, you can read the masses and spins off of the NR data when the system is orbiting at angular velocity Ωᵢ.  Integrating the post-Newtonian (PN) solution forwards in time from this point will allow you to compare the PN and NR waveforms.  However, you may want to know what the waveform was at earlier times than are present in the NR data.  For this, you also have to integrate backwards in time.  We parametrise the point to which you integrate backwards with Ω₁.  In either case, element 1 of the output solution will have frequency Ω₁ — though by default it is equal to Ωᵢ.\n\nSimilarly, the optional argument Ωₑ=1 is the frequency of the end element of the solution — that is Julia's notation for the last element.  Note that this is automatically reduced if necessary so that the corresponding PN parameter v is no greater than 1, which may be the case whenever the total mass is greater than 1.\n\nUp-down instability\n\nBe aware that the up-down instability (where the more massive black hole has spin aligned with the orbital angular velocity, and the less massive has spin anti-aligned) can cause systems with nearly zero precession at the initial time to evolve into a highly precessing system either at earlier or later times.  This is a real physical result, rather than a numerical issue.  If you want to simulate a truly non-precessing system, you should explicitly set the in-place components of spin to precisely 0.  By default, we check for this condition, and will issue a warning if it is likely to be encountered for systems with low initial precession.  The function used to compute the unstable region is up_down_instability.\n\nTime-stepper algorithms\n\nTsit5() is a good default choice for time stepper when using Float64 with medium-low tolerance.  If stiffness seems to be impacting the results, AutoTsit5(Rosenbrock23()) will automatically switch when stiffness occurs. For tighter tolerances, especially when using Double64s, Vern9() or AutoVern9(Rodas5()) are good choices.  For very loose tolerances, as when using Float32s, it might be better to use OwrenZen3().\n\nTermination criteria\n\nThe termination criteria are vital to efficiency of the integration and correctness of the solution.  The default values for forwards- and backwards-in-time evolution, respectively, are\n\nCallbackSet(\n    termination_forwards(v(Ω=Ωₑ, M=M₁+M₂)),\n    dtmin_terminator(T),\n    nonfinite_terminator()\n)\n\nand\n\nCallbackSet(\n    termination_backwards(v(Ω=Ω₁, M=M₁+M₂)),\n    dtmin_terminator(T),\n    nonfinite_terminator()\n)\n\nwhere T is the common float type of the input arguments.  If any additional termination criteria are needed, they could be added as additional elements of the CallbackSets.  See the callback documentation for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Computing-mode-weights-from-the-inspiral-data","page":"Home","title":"Computing mode weights from the inspiral data","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"h!","category":"page"},{"location":"#PostNewtonian.h!","page":"Home","title":"PostNewtonian.h!","text":"h!(h, u; ℓmin=0)\nh!(h, M₁, M₂, χ⃗₁ˣ, χ⃗₁ʸ, χ⃗₁ᶻ, χ⃗₂ˣ, χ⃗₂ʸ, χ⃗₂ᶻ, Rʷ, Rˣ, Rʸ, Rᶻ, v; ℓmin=0)\nmode_weights!(h, u; ℓmin=0)\nmode_weights!(h, M₁, M₂, χ⃗₁ˣ, χ⃗₁ʸ, χ⃗₁ᶻ, χ⃗₂ˣ, χ⃗₂ʸ, χ⃗₂ᶻ, Rʷ, Rˣ, Rʸ, Rᶻ, v; ℓmin=0)\n\nCompute mode weights of gravitational waves emitted by pn system, modifying h in place.\n\nThese modes are computed in the \"co-orbital\" frame, in which the larger object lies on the positive x axis, the smaller lies on the negative x axis, and the instantaneous angular velocity is in the positive z direction.\n\nThe modes are stored in h in order of increasing ℓ and increasing m, with m iterating fastest, all the way up to the highest available mode, (88).\n\nBecause gravitational waves have spin weight -2, the (ℓm)=(00), (1-1), (10), and (11) modes are always 0.  By default, we assume that these modes are nonetheless included in h.  If that is not the case, set ℓmin to the smallest ℓ value that should be present in the output data — ℓmin=2 being the most reasonable alternative.\n\nAll non-spinning terms are taken from Blanchet (2014).

If there is no instability expected, the returned pair is just (1,1).\n\nFor compact binaries in which the spins are either aligned or anti-aligned with the orbital angular velocity, we do not expect any precession effects — simply by symmetry.  However, if the spin of the higher-mass object is aligned with the orbital angular velocity and the spin of the lower-mass object is anti-aligned, the binary is unstable to precession — meaning that any minuscule misalignment can grow rapidly into significant precession.  This was first reported by Gerosa et al. (2015), and the range over which the system is unstable is given by Eq. (2) of that reference. We use the lowest-order approximation to convert binary separation to frequency.  The result is also \"clamped\" between 0 and 1, because sometimes the PN approximations involved break down and return unphysical values.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Index-of-all-functions","page":"Home","title":"Index of all functions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"page"}]
