For example, if keyword arguments are accepted as Unicode, ASCII equivalents are usually also accepted.  Some function names are similarly in Unicode, but have ASCII equivalents.  See the various functions' documentation for acceptable replacements.It can be dangerous to use Unicode in Python in particular. Python only accepts a small subset of Unicode — so that M₁ for example is not valid input.  And what it does accept is automatically \"NFKC normalized\". For example, variable names Mₐ, Ma, and Mᵃ are all treated identically by Python.  To illustrate this, consider the following python code:>>> Mₐ = 1\n>>> Mᵃ = 2\n>>> Ma = 3\n>>> print((Mₐ, Mᵃ, Ma))\n(3, 3, 3)We might have expected three different values (1, 2, 3) in the output, but Python never even sees the variable names as different strings; it interprets these expressions as setting, resetting, and resetting again the value of Ma.If you find an example where ASCII substitutions are not possible, please file a bug report.","category":"page"},{"location":"interface/python/#Installation","page":"Python","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"interface/python/#0.-Optionally-pre-install-Julia","page":"Python","title":"0.

Beyond some basic utilities, which are related to how we write the code, rather than post-Newtonian calculations per se, we have the following:","category":"page"},{"location":"internals/code_structure/","page":"Code structure","title":"Code structure","text":"System and state\nObjects of type PNSystem represent the PN system itself and some information about it, including:\nThe Binary type — BBH, BHNS, or NSNS\nThe float type T — Float64, etc.\nThe PN expansion order PNOrder — a Rational\nThe current state of the system, including the fundamental variables\nThe first of these is represented as the type itself, the last is stored as a vector inside the object, and the rest are represented as type parameters.\nNote that basically everything below will be written as a function of such an object, which we will denote pnsystem.\nFundamental variables\nThis consists of the basic variables describing the instantaneous state of the system, including M₁, M₂, χ⃗₁, χ⃗₂, R, v. For systems with matter, this may also include tidal deformability for each star, Λ₁ and Λ₂.\nThese are encapsulated within a PNSystem, but it's important to note that these should all be accessed through functions like M₁(pnsystem) rather than directly like pnsystem.M₁.  This allows Julia's type system to get involved, enabling important optimizations.\nAlso, these variables can be automatically computed in functions that need them with the @pn_expression macro.  For example, you can directly use the symbols M₁, M₂, etc., in a function that is wrapped in that macro, without any qualifiers to specify where those variables are coming from, and the macro will automatically and efficiently evaluate them for you because they are defined in the PostNewtonian.FundamentalVariables module.\nDerived variables\nThese are variables that are frequently used in PN expressions that can be computed from the fundamental variables, and are defined in terms of them.  For example, the total mass M ≔ M₁+M₂, the antisymmetric spin vector χ⃗ₐ ≔ (χ⃗₁-χ⃗₂)/2, or the orbital separation vector n̂ ≔ R x̂ R̄.  While none of these are strictly necessary, it is helpful to be able to write the same variables used in articles providing the PN expressions in the code itself.\nBecause they are defined solely in terms of fundamental variables, which can be computed from an PNSystem alone, these are all written as functions of such an object — such as M(pnsystem), χ⃗ₐ(pnsystem), and n̂(pnsystem).\nAgain, these quantities will be automatically computed for you in any function wrapped in the @pn_expression macro because they are defined in the PostNewtonian.DerivedVariables module.\nPN expressions\nUnlike derived variables, these are not necessarily defined in terms of only the fundamental variables, but they can be calculated in terms of both fundamental and derived variables.  These are generally the result of post-Newtonian expansions — the most important examples being the flux 𝓕, binding energy 𝓔, and the waveform mode weights h! themselves.\nPN expansions\nThese are the specific parts of a \"PN expression\" that are expanded in powers of 1c.  For example, the flux 𝓕 and binding energy 𝓔 are expanded in powers of vc.  When such PN expansions are defined using the @pn_expression macro, any occurrence of c is turned into an object that captures the exponent of c in that expression.  The expansion is automatically truncated at the appropriate order, and then c is finally set to 1 so that the result can be computed as usual.  See PNTerm and PNExpansion for more details.\nDynamics\nThis is where the ODE integration actually occurs, to evolve the orbital dynamics of the system.\nEvaluation\nFinally, we construct the waveforms themselves.  This level contains the main interface that will usually be used from Julia code, and should be restricted to fairly high-level functions like PNWaveform(M₁, M₂, ...), while still handling the full range of options that will be present in \"Dynamics\", for example.\nCompatibility layers\nThis is an optional level of abstraction that allows us to wrap the evaluation layer in functions that are designed to look and act more like other packages' functions.  As of this writing, the only such layer is for GWFrames compatibility, but similar wrappers could certainly be added.","category":"page"},{"location":"developer/#dev_docs","page":"Developer documentation","title":"Developer documentation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"developer/","page":"Developer documentation","title":"Developer documentation","text":"note: Contributing guidelines\nIf you haven't, please read the Contributing guidelines first.","category":"page"},{"location":"developer/","page":"Developer documentation","title":"Developer documentation","text":"If you want to make contributions to this package that involves code, then this guide is for you.","category":"page"},{"location":"developer/#First-time-clone","page":"Developer documentation","title":"First time clone","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"developer/","page":"Developer documentation","title":"Developer documentation","text":"tip: If you have writing rights\nIf you have writing rights, you don't have to fork.

This will ensure that they can be automatically computed using the @pn_expression.\nIt is crucial to explicitly include factors of 1c to the appropriate power relative to the 0-pN order term inside the @pn_expansion macro.  For example, the first couple terms in the binding energy expansion look like\n32/5G * ν^2 * v^10 / c^5 * @pn_expansion(1 + (v/c)^2 * (-1247//336 - 35ν/12))\nThe 1/c^5 factor at the beginning is useful to remind us of the absolute order of this expression, but the 1/c^2 factor inside the @pn_expansion macro is crucial to ensure that the expression can be correctly truncated at the desired order. Thus, if you want to add a new 6-pN term to the binding energy, you could either manually code it inside the @pn_expansion expression, including its 1/c^12 factor, or you could create a separate function that should look like this:\n@pn_expression function binding_energy_6pn(pnsystem::PNSystem)\n    32/5G * ν^2 * v^12 / c^5 * @pn_expansion((v/c)^12 * 17//4)\nend\nNote that we have kept the 1/c^5 factor out front, and the 1/c^12 factor inside the @pn_expansion macro.  This tells the compiler that this is a 6-pN term, so if the user requests a lower pN order, the term should be ignored.\nIt should be possible to evaluate PN expressions using different precisions.  To ensure this, enter fractions as Irrationals — e.g., 9//5 instead of 9/5.  The latter would be immediately converted to the inexact 64-bit float value 1.8, which would poison other values.  Note that if you are multiplying by something else that already has general float type, as in 9π/5, you don't need to use Irrational; in this case, 9π is evaluated first and achieves full precision, and is then divided by the exact integer 5, so that it retains full precision.  Note that a helpful regex to search for this case is (?<!(ζ|n|\\^))[0-9]+/[0-9], which has relatively few false positives in this repo.\nA slight caveat to the above is that an expression like 3λ/2 could still be converted to Float64 if λ is defined at compile time to be 0.  For type-stability reasons, Julia will always treat 0/2 just like it would treat 7/2, which is converted to Float64.  Thus, it is probably safest to write expressions like 3//2 * λ.\nIf you happen to use any other math functions, similarly ensure that their arguments are converted appropriately to retain precision.

The physical interpretation of that part is that any system with such spin components will not merge as quickly because the remnant black hole must have total dimensionless spin less than 1, so excess angular momentum must be radiated away.

It seems that the actual ranges of the spin magnitudes and masses are restricted based on initial guesses, which may be expanded to ensure that the posteriors lie entirely within the priors.  The distance priors are uniform in D_mathrmL^2, with some adjustments due to cosmology.\n\nFor the purposes of this package, we're not too interested in absolute scales — specifically distance or total mass — so we'll just choose the total mass to be 1 at the initial frequency, then sample based on mass ratio and spin magnitudes.\n\nGiven these, it seems like the current state of the art would be well covered by choosing a random q ∈ [0.05, 1], χᵢ ∈ [0, 0.998], and Λᵢ ∈ [0, 5000], with isotropic choices for orientations.

See below for an explanation of the different meanings of \"initial\" and \"first\" in this context.  Note that the masses change in time as a result of tidal heating — though the changes are quite small throughout most of the inspiral.  The spins change direction due to precession, but also change in magnitude due to tidal heating.  Therefore, the values passed here are only precisely as given precisely at the moment of the initial data corresponding to the frequency Ωᵢ.\n\nKeyword arguments\n\nNote that several of these keywords are given as Unicode but can also be given as the ASCII string noted.  For example, Λ₁ may be input as Lambda1 equivalently; the default values are the same, regardless.\n\nΛ₁=0 or Lambda1: Tidal-coupling parameter of object 1.\nΛ₂=0 or Lambda2: Tidal-coupling parameter of object 2.\nΩ₁=Ωᵢ or Omega_1: First angular frequency in output data.  This may be less than Ωᵢ, in which case we integrate backwards to this point, and combine the backwards and forwards solutions into one seamless output.  (See next section.)\nΩₑ=Ω(v=1,M=M₁+M₂) or Omega_e: Final angular frequency at which to stop ODE integration.  Note that integration may stop before the system reaches this frequency, if we detect that PN has broken down irretrievably — for example, if one of the masses is no longer strictly positive, if a spin is super-extremal, or the PN velocity parameter v is decreasing, or is no longer in the range (0,1).

Note that a true value here is critical if the dtmin_terminator callback is to have any effect.\nquiet=true: If set to false, informational messages about successful terminations of the ODE integrations (which occur when the target v is reached in either direction) will be provided.

Note that this conflicts with the saveat option noted below.\n\nAll remaining keyword arguments are passed to the solve function of DiffEqBase.  See that function's documentation for details, including useful keyword arguments.  The most likely important one is\n\nsaveat: Denotes specific times to save the solution at, during the solving phase — either a time step or a vector of specific times.\n\nIn particular, if you want the solution to be output at uniform time steps δt, you want to pass something like saveat=δt; you don't want the solve keyword dt, which is just the initial suggestion for adaptive systems.  It is not permitted to pass this option and the saves_per_orbit option.\n\nAlso note that callback can be used, and is combined with the callbacks generated by the termination_criteria_* arguments above.  That is, you can use the default ones and your own by passing arguments to callback.  See the documentation for more details, but note that if you want to make your own callbacks, you will need to add OrdinaryDiffEq to your project — or possibly even DifferentialEquations for some of the fancier built-in callbacks.\n\nODE system\n\nThe evolved variables, in order, are\n\nM₁: Mass of black hole 1\nM₂: Mass of black hole 2\nχ⃗₁ˣ: x component of dimensionless spin of black hole 1\nχ⃗₁ʸ: y component...\nχ⃗₁ᶻ: z component...\nχ⃗₂ˣ: x component of dimensionless spin of black hole 2\nχ⃗₂ʸ: y component...\nχ⃗₂ᶻ: z component...\nRʷ: Scalar component of frame rotor\nRˣ: x component...\nRʸ: y component...\nRᶻ: z component...\nv: PN \"velocity\" parameter related to the total mass M and orbital angular frequency Ω by v = (M Ω)^13\nΦ: Orbital phase given by integrating Ω\n\nThe masses and spin magnitudes evolve according to tidal_heating.  The spin directions evolve according to Ω⃗ᵪ₁ and Ω⃗ᵪ₂.  The frame precesses with angular velocity Ω⃗ₚ, while also rotating with angular frequency Ω about the Newtonian orbital angular velocity direction.  The frame rotor R is given by integrating the sum of these angular velocities as described in Boyle (2016).  And finally, the PN parameter v evolves according to something like\n\ndotv = - fracmathcalF + dotM_1 + dotM_2 mathcalE\n\nwhere 𝓕 is the flux of gravitational-wave energy out of the system, dotM_1 and dotM_2 are due to tidal coupling as computed by tidal_heating, and 𝓔′ is the derivative of the binding energy with respect to v.  For \"TaylorT1\", the right-hand side of this equation is evaluated as given; for \"TaylorT4\", the right-hand side is first expanded as a Taylor series in v and then truncated at some desired order; for \"TaylorT5\", the inverse of the right-hand side is expanded as a Taylor series in v, truncated at some desired order, and then inverted to obtain an expression in terms of v.\n\nReturned solution\n\nThe returned quantity is an ODESolution object, which has various features for extracting and interpolating the data.  We'll call this object sol.\n\nnote: Note\nThe solution comes with data at the time points the ODE integrator happened to step to.  However, it also comes with dense output (unless you manually turn it off when calling orbital_evolution).  This means that you can interpolate the solution to any other set of time points you want simply by calling it as sol(t) for some vector of time points t.  The quantity returned by that will have all the features described below, much like the original solution.  Note that if you only want some of the data, you can provide the optional keyword argument idxs to specify which of the elements described below you want to interpolate.  For example, if you only want to interpolate the values of M₁ and M₂, you can use sol(t, idxs=[1,2]).\n\nThe field sol.t is the set of time points at which the solution is given.  To access the ith variable at time step j, use sol[i, j].[1] You can also use colons.  For example, sol[:, j] is a vector of all the data at time step j, and sol[i, :] is a vector of the ith variable at all times.\n\n[1]: Here, the ith variable just refers to which number it has in the list of evolved   variables in the ODE system, as described under \"ODE system\".\n\nFor convenience, you can also access the individual variables with their symbols.  For example, sol[:v] returns a vector of the PN velocity parameter at each time step.  Note the colon in :v, which is Julia's notation for a Symbol.\n\nInitial frequency vs. first frequency vs. end frequency\n\nNote the distinction between Ωᵢ (with subscript i) and Ω₁ (with subscript 1).  The first, Ωᵢ, represents the angular frequency of the initial condition from which the ODE integrator will begin; the second, Ω₁, represents the target angular frequency of the first element of the output data.  That is, the ODE integration will run forwards in time from Ωᵢ to the merger, and then — if Ωᵢ>Ω₁ — come back to Ωᵢ and run backwards in time to Ω₁.  The output data will stitch these two together to be one continuous (forwards-in-time) data series.\n\nFor example, if you are trying to match to a numerical relativity (NR) simulation, you can read the masses and spins off of the NR data when the system is orbiting at angular frequency Ωᵢ.  Integrating the post-Newtonian (PN) solution forwards in time from this point will allow you to compare the PN and NR waveforms.  However, you may want to know what the waveform was at earlier times than are present in the NR data.  For this, you also have to integrate backwards in time.  We parameterize the point to which you integrate backwards with Ω₁.  In either case, element 1 of the output solution will have frequency Ω₁ — though by default it is equal to Ωᵢ.\n\nSimilarly, the optional argument Ωₑ=1 is the frequency of the end element of the solution — that is Julia's notation for the last element.  Note that this is automatically reduced if necessary so that the corresponding PN parameter v is no greater than 1, which may be the case whenever the total mass is greater than 1.\n\nUp-down instability\n\nBe aware that the up-down instability (where the more massive black hole has spin aligned with the orbital angular velocity, and the less massive has spin anti-aligned) can cause systems with nearly zero precession at the initial time to evolve into a highly precessing system either at earlier or later times.  This is a real physical result, rather than a numerical issue.  If you want to simulate a truly non-precessing system, you should explicitly set the in-place components of spin to precisely 0.  By default, we check for this condition, and will issue a warning if it is likely to be encountered for systems with low initial precession.  The function used to compute the unstable region is up_down_instability.\n\nTime-stepper algorithms\n\nTsit5() is a good default choice for time stepper when using Float64 with medium-low tolerance.  If stiffness seems to be impacting the results, AutoTsit5(Rosenbrock23()) will automatically switch when stiffness occurs.  For tighter tolerances, especially when using Double64s, Vern9() or AutoVern9(Rodas5P()) are good choices.  For very loose tolerances, as when using Float32s, it might be better to use OwrenZen3().\n\nTermination criteria\n\nThe termination criteria are vital to efficiency of the integration and correctness of the solution.  The default values for forwards- and backwards-in-time evolution, respectively, are\n\nCallbackSet(\n    termination_forwards(v(Ω=Ωₑ, M=M₁+M₂)),\n    dtmin_terminator(T),\n    decreasing_v_terminator(),\n    nonfinite_terminator()\n)\n\nand\n\nCallbackSet(\n    termination_backwards(v(Ω=Ω₁, M=M₁+M₂)),\n    dtmin_terminator(T),\n    nonfinite_terminator()\n)\n\nwhere T is the common float type of the input arguments.  If any additional termination criteria are needed, they could be added as additional elements of the CallbackSets.  See the callback documentation for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"internals/dynamics/#PostNewtonian.uniform_in_phase","page":"Dynamics","title":"PostNewtonian.uniform_in_phase","text":"uniform_in_phase(solution, saves_per_orbit)\n\nInterpolate solution to uniform steps in phase.\n\nBy default, the solution returned by orbital_evolution may be sampled very sparsely — too sparsely to satisfy the Nyquist limit of the waveform.

However, if the spin of the higher-mass object is aligned with the orbital angular velocity and the spin of the lower-mass object is anti-aligned, the binary is unstable to precession — meaning that any minuscule misalignment can grow rapidly into significant precession.  This was first reported by Gerosa et al. (2015), and the range over which the system is unstable is given by Eq. (2) of that reference.  We use the lowest-order approximation to convert binary separation to frequency.

The PNOrder parameter is the highest order of the series that is allowed to be present in those expansions, so that if PNOrder is effectively infinite, the series will be expanded to the highest order given in any of the PN expansions, but the expansion of the ratio will not go to infinite order.  This is the reason that TaylorT4 and TaylorT5 do not approach TaylorT1 as PNOrder approaches typemax(Int).  This design decision was made to ensure feasibility of the calculations.","category":"page"},{"location":"internals/dynamics/","page":"Dynamics","title":"Dynamics","text":"Note that, internally, the TaylorT* functions call causes_domain_error!.
