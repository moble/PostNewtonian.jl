# We want to precompile all branches of the code, so we have to input a variety of
# arguments.  We can look at the `ArgParse` stuff in the main function to see what options
# are available.
#
# The first group of arguments describes the mass and spin parameters of the binary system.
# These shouldn't affect the branches significantly, so we can just use one set of those
# arguments.
#
# The next group requires exactly one of `D0`, `Omega0, `tMerger`, or `NOrbits` to be
# passed.  Again, the precise values shouldn't affect branching much, so we use just one set
# of arguments.
#
# The next group is not yet implemented, so we skip it for now.
#
# The final group includes two flags.  The first allows us to skip the up-down-instability
# check, which would only skip a branch, so we just leave it out.  The second is for the D0
# hack, so we run both with and without to exercise both options.
