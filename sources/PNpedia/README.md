# PNpedia

This directory contains code to translate results from David
Trestini's [PNpedia](https://github.com/davidtrestini/PNpedia) — which
are given as `.txt` files containing Mathematica output — into Julia
code.

Though it is `.gitignore`d, to run the code you should first clone
PNpedia into this directory, so that the files are available

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidtrestini/PNpedia.git
```
