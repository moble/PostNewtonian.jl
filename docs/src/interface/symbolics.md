# Symbolic manipulations

It can be useful to evaluate the post-Newtonian expressions with
symbolic arguments.  To do so, we just need to create a `PNSystem`
containing a `state` vector of symbols.  All of the variables defined
in [`PostNewtonian.FundamentalVariables`](@ref "Fundamental
variables") and [`PostNewtonian.DerivedVariables`](@ref "Derived
variables") have methods defined automatically to generate symbols
instead of values when called with a symbolic `PNSystem`.  In turn,
any function modified by the [`@pn_expression`](@ref
PostNewtonian.@pn_expression) macro should also be able to return a
symbolic result, including all functions described in the "[PN
expressions](@ref)" section.

For convenience, an extension to this package also provides
[`SymbolicPNSystem`](@ref PostNewtonian.SymbolicPNSystem), which
produces a `PNSystem` with all the fundamental variables stored as
[`Symbolics.jl`](https://symbolics.juliasymbolics.org/) variables ‚Äî as
long as the `Symbolics` package is also loaded.  We can extract the
symbols as usual:
```julia
julia> using PostNewtonian, Symbolics

julia> symbolic_pnsystem = PostNewtonian.SymbolicPNSystem()
PostNewtonian.SymbolicPNSystem{Vector{Num}, 9223372036854775805//2, Num}(Num[M‚ÇÅ, M‚ÇÇ, œá‚Éó‚ÇÅÀ£, œá‚Éó‚ÇÅ ∏, œá‚Éó‚ÇÅ·∂ª, œá‚Éó‚ÇÇÀ£, œá‚Éó‚ÇÇ ∏, œá‚Éó‚ÇÇ·∂ª, R ∑, RÀ£, R ∏, R·∂ª, v, Œ¶], Œõ‚ÇÅ, Œõ‚ÇÇ)

julia> v = PostNewtonian.v(symbolic_pnsystem)
v
```
More generally, we can obtain a symbolic expression for the [binding
energy](@ref PostNewtonian.ùìî) as
```julia
julia> ùìî(symbolic_pnsystem)
(-1//2)*(1 + (v^2)*(-(3//4) - (1//12)*ŒΩ) + (v^3)*((14//3)*s‚Çó + 2Œ¥*œÉ‚Çó) + [...]
```
In fact, this is how the [derivative-of-binding-energy function
`ùìî‚Ä≤`](@ref PostNewtonian.ùìî‚Ä≤) used to be constructed, essentially as
```julia
julia> ‚àÇ·µ• = Differential(v);

julia> expand_derivatives(‚àÇ·µ•(ùìî(symbolic_pnsystem)))
-(1 + (v^2)*(-(3//4) - (1//12)*ŒΩ) + (v^3)*((14//3)*s‚Çó + 2Œ¥*œÉ‚Çó) + [...]
```

Note that special care is taken to preserve the types of `Irrational`s
and the arguments of certain functions like `sqrt` and `log`.
Ordinarily, Julia will evaluate these as `Float64`s; to ensure that
they remain symbolic, we have to wrap them in a function that
`Symbolics.jl` will know not to bother expanding:
[`PostNewtonian.hold`](@ref).  While manipulating these expressions
symbolically, you'll probably want to leave those `hold` calls as they
are.  If you convert the expressions to code, Julia will compile them
away easily, so you don't need to do anything more.  However, you
*can* remove them using [`PostNewtonian.unhold`](@ref) if the code is
in
[`Expr`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/#Program-representation)
form.
