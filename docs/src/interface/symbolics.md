# Symbolic manipulations

It can be useful to evaluate the post-Newtonian expressions with symbolic
arguments.  To do so, we just need to create a `PNSystem` containing a `state`
vector of symbols.  All of the variables defined in
[`PostNewtonian.FundamentalVariables`](@ref "Fundamental variables") and
[`PostNewtonian.DerivedVariables`](@ref "Derived variables") have methods defined
automatically to generate symbols instead of values when called with a symbolic
`PNSystem`.  In turn, any function modified by the
[`@pn_expression`](@ref PostNewtonian.@pn_expression) macro should
also be able to return a symbolic result, including all functions described in
the "[PN expressions](@ref)" section.

For convenience, this package provides [`symbolic_pnsystem`](@ref), which has
all the fundamental variables stored as
[`Symbolics.jl`](https://symbolics.juliasymbolics.org/) variables.  We can
extract the symbols as usual:
```julia
julia> v = PostNewtonian.v(symbolic_pnsystem)
v
```
More generally, we can obtain a symbolic expression for the [binding energy](@ref
PostNewtonian.ùìî) as
```julia
julia> ùìî(symbolic_pnsystem)
(-1//2)*M*ŒΩ*(1 + ((19//8)*ŒΩ - (27//8) - (1//24)*(ŒΩ^2))*(v^4) + (ŒΩ*(œá‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ + 6(œá‚Çê‚Çó^2)) + [...]
```
In fact, this is how the [derivative-of-binding-energy function `ùìî‚Ä≤`](@ref
PostNewtonian.ùìî‚Ä≤) is constructed, essentially as
```julia
julia> ‚àÇ·µ• = Differential(v);

julia> expand_derivatives(‚àÇ·µ•(ùìî(symbolic_pnsystem)))
(-1//2)*M*ŒΩ*((-90(v^9)*((M‚ÇÇ*Œª‚ÇÅ) / M‚ÇÅ + (M‚ÇÅ*Œª‚ÇÇ) / M‚ÇÇ)) / (M^5) + [...]
```

Note that special care is taken to preserve the types of `Irrational`s and the
arguments of certain functions like `sqrt` and `log`.  Ordinarily, Julia will
evaluate these as `Float64`s; to ensure that they remain symbolic, we have to
wrap them in a function that `Symbolics.jl` will know not to bother expanding:
[`PostNewtonian.hold`](@ref).  While manipulating these expressions
symbolically, you'll probably want to leave those `hold` calls as they are.  If
you convert the expressions to code, Julia will compile them away easily, so you
don't need to do anything more.  However, you *can* remove them using
[`PostNewtonian.unhold`](@ref) if the code is in
[`Expr`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/#Program-representation)
form.
