Additionally, there are numerous convenience functions to give certain
components of the spins.  They take a single `pnsystem` argument and are not
exported.  Given the definitions above, they are all fairly self explanatory —
such as `χ₁²`, which gives `χ⃗₁ ⋅ χ⃗₁`; or `χ₁₂ = χ⃗₁ ⋅ χ⃗₂`; or `Sₙ = S⃗ ⋅ n̂`.
Like all the other fundamental and derived variables, these can be used directly
in PN expressions modified by the [`@pn_expression`](@ref
PostNewtonian.@pn_expression) macro.

## Horizons

We can also compute some variables defined by [Alvi
(2001)](http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.64.104020) related to the
horizons.  The hardest parts to compute here involve the relative angles between
the spins and the black-hole separation vectors.  Alvi constructs a spherical
coordinate system centered on each black hole where the ``z`` axis is given by
the direction of the spin, and ``\theta`` and ``\phi`` represent the direction
to the other black hole.  While he makes a (somewhat ambiguous) choice about the
origin of the ``\phi`` coordinate, only ``\dot{\phi}`` comes into the equations,
so we don't really care about that origin.

Note that Alvi uses ``\mathbf{n}`` to represent the "normal to the orbital
plane", whereas we — and most of the rest of the post-Newtonian literature — use
[``\hat{\ell}``](@ref PostNewtonian.ℓ̂) for this vector and [``\hat{n}``](@ref
PostNewtonian.n̂) to represent the separation vector pointing *from* object 2
*to* object 1.  For convenience, we define

```math
\hat{n}_i = \begin{cases}
-\hat{n} & \text{i=1}, \\
\hphantom{-}\hat{n} & \text{i=2}.
\end{cases}
```

Alvi's construction is also somewhat adiabatic, so we treat the spins and
orbital plane as constant in the calculation of the instantaneous tidal heating
— though they evolve slowly over time — and the angles ``\theta`` and ``\phi``
as evolving rapidly.  In our formulation, then, the goal is to find the angle
``\theta_i(t)`` between ``\vec{\chi}_i`` and ``\hat{n}_i``, and the rotation
rate ``\dot{\phi}_i(t)`` of ``\hat{n}_i`` about the ``\vec{\chi}_i`` axis.

Computing the angle between vectors is a somewhat infamously tricky problem.
There are various
[claims](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Triangle.pdf) floating around
about the best ways to compute quantities involving areas and angles of
triangles.  While these claims are [surely true for
areas](https://inria.hal.science/hal-00790071), I am more skeptical of the
relevance for angles.  I find it best to realize that you probably don't need
the angle *per se*, but trigonometric functions of the angle — like ``\sin^2
\theta_i``, which is what we actually need in this case.  In particular, I
believe the best results come from computing

```math
\sin^2\theta_i = \frac{
    \left|\hat{n}_i \times \vec{\chi}_i\right|^2
}{
    \left| \vec{\chi}_i\right|^2
}.
```

If the denominator is zero, we set ``\sin^2\theta_i = 1`` from physical
considerations.

Now consider the quantity ``\hat{n}_i \times \vec{\chi}_i``.  We next aim to
calculate the rotation rate ``\dot{\phi}_i`` of this vector about
``\vec{\chi}_i``.  We begin by directly calculating

```math
\partial_t \left(\hat{n}_i \times \vec{\chi}_i\right)
=
\left(\partial_t \hat{n}_i\right) \times \vec{\chi}_i
=
\left(\Omega\, \hat{\ell} \times \hat{n}_i\right) \times \vec{\chi}_i
=
\mp \Omega\, \hat{\lambda} \times \vec{\chi}_i,
```

where the negative sign is chosen for ``i=1`` and positive for ``i=2``.  Now,
from more fundamental considerations, we can understand the components of this
change.  Since we assume that ``\vec{\chi}_i`` is constant at each instant for
the purposes of calculation here, the only way for ``\hat{n}_i \times
\vec{\chi}_i`` to change is either because ``\hat{n}_i`` rotates about
``\vec{\chi}_i``, or because the angle ``\theta_i`` is changing.  We can express
this as

```math
\partial_t \left(\hat{n}_i \times \vec{\chi}_i\right)
=
\left( \dot{\phi}\, \hat{\chi}_i \right) \times \left(\hat{n}_i \times \vec{\chi}_i\right)
+
\dot{\theta_i}\, \cot \theta_i\, \left(\hat{n}_i \times \vec{\chi}_i\right).
```

Since these two components are orthogonal, we can obtain ``\dot{\phi}`` directly
by taking the component of this quantity along ``\hat{\chi}_i \times
\left(\hat{n}_i \times \vec{\chi}_i\right)``:

```math
\dot{\phi}_i
=
\frac{
    \left( \Omega\, \hat{\lambda} \times \vec{\chi}_i \right)
    \cdot
    \left(
        \vphantom{\hat{\lambda}} \hat{\chi}_i
        \times
        \left(\hat{n} \times \vec{\chi}_i\right)
    \right)
}{
    \left| \hat{\chi}_i \times \left(\hat{n} \times \vec{\chi}_i\right) \right|^2
}
=
\Omega\, \frac{\hat{\ell} \cdot \hat{\chi}_i}{\sin^2 \theta_i}.
```

Here again, we may run into numerical trouble if ``\left| \vec{\chi}_1 \right| \approx 0``,
in which case we again use physical arguments to take ``\dot{\phi}_i = \Omega``.
We might also expect to run into trouble if ``\sin^2 \theta_i \approx 0``, which
corresponds to a polar orbit, in which case Alvi's approximations break down.
This turns out to not be a problem *numerically*, because of the cancellation
with the numerator, except when ``\sin^2 \theta_i = 0`` exactly.  In this case,
we choose ``\dot{\phi}_i = 0``.

Note that the sign of ``\hat{n}_i`` has dropped out of the calculations of both
``\sin^2\theta_i`` and ``\dot{\phi}_i``, cancelling with the signs that had
appeared next to ``\Omega``.
