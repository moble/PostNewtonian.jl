# PostNewtonian

This package computes orbital dynamics of and waveforms from binary black-hole
systems, in the [post-Newtonian
approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Newtonian_expansion).
Currently, there is no support for eccentric systems, but general precessing
quasicircular systems are supported.

## Installation

If you intend to use this package via Python, see [this page](@ref
Using-this-package-from-Python) for installation instructions.

It is recommended to use this package with Julia version 1.9 or greater, because
of that version's improved pre-compilation caching.  If you find it very slow
the first time you use functions from this package in a new Julia session, that
is most likely because Julia has to compile a lot of code.  Version 1.9 does a
better job of caching that compiled code, which speeds up your first-time usage.

If you haven't installed Julia yet, you probably want to use
[`juliaup`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#readme) to do so.  You'll
probably also want to use a Julia ["project
environment"](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/) specifically for
using this package.  An easy way to do this is to create a directory, `cd` into
that directory, and then run julia as
```
julia --project=.
```
Then, installation of this package involves the usual commands:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("PostNewtonian")
```

## Quick start

!!! tip
    You don't have to [use cool Unicode
    names](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/unicode-input/) for
    your variables if you don't want to.  For example, `chi1` works just
    as well as `œá‚Éó‚ÇÅ`.  Similarly, many functions in this package have
    Unicode names or take optional Unicode keyword arguments; the
    documentation for those functions will point out possible ASCII
    substitutions.

We can integrate the orbital dynamics of a black-hole binary using the
[`orbital_evolution`](@ref) function.  Here, we arbitrarily choose something
close to a [hangup-kick](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04382) configuration.
```@example 1
using PostNewtonian

# Initial values of the masses, spins, and orbital angular frequency
M‚ÇÅ = 0.6
M‚ÇÇ = 0.4
œá‚Éó‚ÇÅ = [0.7, 0.1, 0.7]
œá‚Éó‚ÇÇ = [-0.7, 0.1, 0.7]
Œ©·µ¢ = 0.01

inspiral = orbital_evolution(M‚ÇÅ, M‚ÇÇ, œá‚Éó‚ÇÅ, œá‚Éó‚ÇÇ, Œ©·µ¢)
nothing;  # hide
```
There are numerous optional keyword arguments to `orbital_evolution`,
controlling things like the range of frequencies over which to integrate
(including possibly both backwards *and* forwards from `Œ©·µ¢`), accuracy of the
ODE integration, time steps at which to save the results, the PN order at which
to compute the evolution equations, and so on.  See that function's
[documentation](@ref orbital_evolution) for details.

The returned `inspiral` object is an
[`ODESolution`](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/basics/solution/) object
with many features, like high-order interpolation (using dense output from the
ODE integrator).  The time steps at which the solution was saved are available
as `inspiral.t`, and the evolved variables are available as `inspiral.u`, or by
their names as in `inspiral[:v]` or `inspiral[:Œ¶]`.  For example, we can plot
the components of the spin of object 1 like this:
```@example 1
using Plots
plotlyjs()  # Requires also adding `PlotlyJS` to your project
default(size=(800,480), linewidth=2, leg=:top)  # hide

plot(
    inspiral, idxs=[(0,:œá‚Éó‚ÇÅÀ£), (0,:œá‚Éó‚ÇÅ ∏), (0,:œá‚Éó‚ÇÅ·∂ª)],
    xlabel="Time (ùëÄ)", ylabel="Dimensionless spin components"
)
savefig("inspiral_spins.html"); nothing  # hide
```
```@raw html
<iframe src="inspiral_spins.html" style="height:500px;width:100%;"></iframe>
```
As expected, we see *significant* precession of the spin.

Usually, we will also want the actual waveform from this system.  We can just
call [`inertial_waveform`](@ref) (or [`coorbital_waveform`](@ref) for the
waveform in a rotating frame in which the binary is not rotating).  For nicer
plotting, we'll first interpolate the inspiral to a finer set of time steps
given by `t‚Ä≤`, going from ``5,000M`` before the end of the inspiral, to the end
of the inspiral, and evaluated every ``0.5M``:
```@example 1
t‚Ä≤ = inspiral.t[end]-5_000 : 0.5 : inspiral.t[end]
h = inertial_waveform(inspiral(t‚Ä≤))
nothing;  # hide
```
Again, we can plot the result:
```@example 1
plot(t‚Ä≤, real.(h[1, :]), label="Re{h‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÇ}")
plot!(t‚Ä≤, imag.(h[1, :]), label="Im{h‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÇ}")
plot!(t‚Ä≤, abs.(h[1, :]), label="|h‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÇ|", linewidth=3)
plot!(xlabel="Time (ùëÄ)", ylabel="Mode weights", ylim=(-1,1))
savefig("waveform.html"); nothing  # hide
```
```@raw html
<iframe src="waveform.html" style="height:500px;width:100%;"></iframe>
```
We see large oscillations in the amplitude of the ``h_{2,2}`` mode on the
orbital timescale, which is to be expected in a hangup-kick scenario as the
system alternates between beaming power preferentially along the ``+z`` and
``-z`` directions.
