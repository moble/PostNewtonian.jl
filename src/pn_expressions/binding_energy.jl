    𝓔(pnsystem)
    binding_energy(pnsystem)

Compute the gravitational binding energy of a compact binary.

Note that this may not be as useful as its derivative, [`𝓔′`](@ref), which is used as part
of the right-hand side for orbital evolutions.

The nonspinning orbital binding energy is known through 4pN.  The expressions through 3.5pN
here come from Eq. (233) of [Blanchet (2014)](https://doi.org/10.12942/lrr-2014-2).

The 4pN term from Eq. (5.2d) of [Jaranowski and Schäfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3225v1)
is known exactly, now that the ``ν``-linear piece is given as Eq. (32) of [Bini and Damour
(2013a)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4884v1).  The remaining terms are not known exactly, but
[Bini and Damour (2013b)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2503v2) have derived some terms, though
there is incomplete information, which are noted as the constants in this code.

The spin-orbit terms in the energy are now complete to 4.0pN (the last term is zero).  These
terms come from Eq. (4.6) of [Bohé et al. (2012)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5520v2).

The spin-squared terms (by which we mean both spin-spin and spin-orbit squared terms) in the
energy are known to 3pN order, and given in Eq. (3.33) of [Bohé et al.
(2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01529).

The spin-cubed terms are known to 3.5pN order, and come from Eq. (6.17) of [Marsat
(2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4118).

The tidal-coupling terms come in to the binding energy at relative 5pN order, and are known
to 6pN order.  These terms come from Eq. (2.11) of [Vines et al.
(2011)](https://prd.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v83/i8/e084051).  Note their unusual convention for
mass ratios, where ``χ₁ = m₁/m`` in their notation; in particular, ``χ`` is not a spin
parameter.  Also note that ``λ̂ = λ₂ v^{10}/(m₁+m₂)^5``, and we need to add the coupling
terms again with ``1 ↔ 2``.  Finally, note the normalization difference, where a different
overall factor is used, leading to a sign difference.
