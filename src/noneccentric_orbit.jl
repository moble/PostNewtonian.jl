    noneccentric_evolution(M₁, M₂, χ⃗₁, χ⃗₂, Ωᵢ; kwargs...)

Integrate the orbital dynamics of a non-eccentric compact binary.


## Keyword arguments

  * `Ω₁=Ωᵢ`: First angular velocity in output data (see next section).
  * `Ωₑ=1`: Final angular velocity at which to stop ODE integration.
  * `Rᵢ=Rotor(true)`: Initial orientation of binary.
  * `PNSys=TaylorT1`: Not actually used currently.
  * `PNOrder=7//2`: Not actually used currently.
  * `check_up_down_instability=true`: Warn if the [Up-down instability](@ref)
    is likely to affect this system.
  * `time_stepper=AutoVern9(Rodas5())`: Choice of solver in OrdinaryDiffEq to
    integrate ODE.
  * `abstol=eps(T)^(11//16)`: Absolute tolerance of ODE solver, where `T` is
    the common type to which all the positional arguments are promoted.  This
    is the tolerance on local error estimates, not necessarily the global
    error.
  * `reltol=eps(T)^(11//16)`: Relative tolerance of ODE solver.  (As above.)
  * `termination_criteria_forwards=nothing`: Callbacks to `solve` for
    forwards-in-time evolution.  See below for discussion of the default value.
  * `termination_criteria_backwards=nothing`: Callbacks to `solve` for
    backwards-in-time evolution.  See below for discussion of the default value.
  * `force_dtmin=true`: If `dt` decreases below the integrator's own minimum,
    and this is false, the integrator will immediately raise an error, before
    the termination criteria have the chance to exit gracefully.  Note that a
    true value here is critical if the `dtmin_terminator` callback is to have
    any effect.

All remaining keyword arguments are passed to the [`solve`
function](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqBase.jl/blob/8e6173029c630f6908252f3fc28a69c1f0eab456/src/solve.jl#L393)
of `DiffEqBase`.  See that function's documentation for details, including
useful keyword arguments.  The most likely important ones are

  * `saveat`: Denotes specific times to save the solution at, during the
    solving phase.
  * `adaptive`: Turns on adaptive timestepping for appropriate methods. Default
    is true.
  * `dt`: Sets the initial stepsize. Defaults to an automatic choice if the
    method is adaptive.
  * `dtmax`: Maximum dt for adaptive timestepping.
  * `dtmin`: Minimum dt for adaptive timestepping.

Note that `callback` is already used by this function (in addition to the
`abstol` and `reltol` mentioned above), which currently makes it impossible to
modify the callbacks.  Hacking will be required to change that.


## Initial frequency vs. first frequency vs. end frequency

Note the distinction between `Ωᵢ` (with subscript `i`) and `Ω₁` (with subscript
`1`).  The first, `Ωᵢ`, represents the angular velocity of the *initial
condition* from which the ODE integrator will begin; the second, `Ω₁`,
represents the target angular velocity of the first element of the output data.
That is, the ODE integration will run forwards in time from `Ωᵢ` to the merger,
and then come back to `Ωᵢ` and run backwards in time to `Ω₁`.  The output data
will stitch these two together to be one continuous (forwards-in-time) data
series.

For example, if you are trying to match to a numerical relativity (NR)
simulation, you can read the masses and spins off of the NR data when the
system is orbiting at angular velocity `Ωᵢ`.  Integrating the post-Newtonian
(PN) solution forwards in time from this point will allow you to compare the PN
and NR waveforms.  However, you may want to know what the waveform was at
*earlier* times than are present in the NR data.  For this, you also have to
integrate backwards in time.  We parametrise the point to which you integrate
backwards with `Ω₁`.  In either case, element `1` of the output solution will
have frequency `Ω₁` — though by default it is equal to `Ωᵢ`.

Similarly, the optional argument `Ωₑ=1` is the frequency of the `end` element
of the solution — that is Julia's notation for the last element.  Note that
this is automatically reduced if necessary so that the corresponding PN
parameter ``v`` is no greater than 1, which may be the case whenever the total
mass is greater than 1.


## Up-down instability

Be aware that the [up-down instability](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.09116) (where
the more massive black hole has spin aligned with the orbital angular velocity,
and the less massive has spin anti-aligned) can cause systems with nearly zero
precession at the initial time to evolve into a highly precessing system either
at earlier or later times.  This is a real physical result, rather than a
numerical issue.  If you want to simulate a truly non-precessing system, you
should explicitly set the in-place components of spin to precisely 0.  By
default, we check for this condition, and will issue a warning if it is likely
to be encountered for systems with low initial precession.  The function used
to compute the unstable region is [`up_down_instability`](@ref).


## Time-stepper algorithms

`Tsit5()` is a good default choice for time stepper when using `Float64` with
medium-low tolerance.  If stiffness seems to be impacting the results,
`AutoTsit5(Rosenbrock23())` will automatically switch when stiffness occurs.
For tighter tolerances, especially when using `Double64`s, `Vern9()` or
`AutoVern9(Rodas5())` are good choices.  For very loose tolerances, as when
using `Float32`s, it might be better to use `OwrenZen3()`.


## Termination criteria

The termination criteria are vital to efficiency of the integration and
correctness of the solution.  The default values for forwards- and
backwards-in-time evolution, respectively, are
```julia
CallbackSet(
    termination_forwards(v(Ω=Ωₑ, M=M₁+M₂)),
    dtmin_terminator(T),
    nonfinite_terminator()
)
```
and
```julia
CallbackSet(
    termination_backwards(v(Ω=Ω₁, M=M₁+M₂)),
    dtmin_terminator(T),
    nonfinite_terminator()
)
```
where `T` is the common float type of the input arguments.  If any additional
termination criteria are needed, they could be added as additional elements of
the `CallbackSet`s.  See the [callback
documentation](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/features/callback_functions/) for
details.
