    κ₁(s)

The "quadrupolar polarisability" of object 1 used by [Bohé et al.
(2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01529).

Note that Bohé et al. refer to the closely related (and co-authored) [Marsat
(2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4118), who notes above Eq. (4.7) that this is denoted
``C_{\mathrm{ES}^2}`` in [Levi and Steinhoff (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2601), who
in turn notes that "we can set ... the Wilson coefficients ``C_{\mathrm{ES}^2} =
C_{\mathrm{BS}^3} = 1`` for the black hole case."

However, a very similar constant ``\kappa_A`` is used in Eq. (2.1) of [Buonanno et al.
(2012)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6349).  They say that ``\kappa_A=1`` for an *isolated*
black hole, but can deviate from 1 for a black hole in a binary — though those deviations
occur at "much higher" order than those they consider (2PN).

See also [`λ₁`](@ref).

!!! warn
    This function will be incorrect for objects other than black holes.  It is not clear to
    me if this is the same quantity as ``C_Q`` used in some papers, such as [Bini and
    Geralico (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5261), but they point out that for neutron
    stars, the value varies between 4.3 and 7.4, depending on the equation of state.  This
    quantity may also be related to [`λ₁`](@ref).  Pull requests or issues with more
