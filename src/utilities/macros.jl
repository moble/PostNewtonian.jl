"""
    @pn_expression [arg_index=1] func

This macro takes the function `func`, looks for various symbols inside that function, and if
present defines them appropriately inside that function.

The first argument to this macro is `arg_index`, which just tells us which argument to the
function `func` is a `PNSystem`.  For example, the variables defined in
[`PostNewtonian.FundamentalVariables`](@ref "Fundamental variables") all take a single
argument of `pnsystem`, which is used to compute the values for those variables; this macro
just needs to know where to find `pnsystem`.

Once it has this information, there are five types of transformations it will make:

 1. Adds a keyword argument `pn_expansion_reducer::Val{PNExpansionReducer}=Val(sum)` to the
    function signature.  This is used to determine how to reduce the PN expansion terms.
    The default is `Val(sum)`, which will just return a single number,  but `Val(identity)`
    can be used to return the expansion.  This should be used inside the function as
    `PNExpansionReducer`, and will be automatically used inside any `@pn_expansion`.
 2. For every [fundamental](@ref "Fundamental variables") or [derived](@ref "Derived
    variables") variable, the name of that variable used in the body of `func` will be
    replaced by its value when called with `pnsystem`.  For example, you can simply use the
    symbols `M‚ÇÅ` or `Œº` in your code, rather than calling them as [`M‚ÇÅ(pnsystem)`](@ref M‚ÇÅ)
    or [`Œº(pnsystem)`](@ref Œº) every time they appear.
 3. Every `Irrational` defined in `Base.MathConstants` or `PostNewtonian.MathConstants` will
    be transformed to the `eltype` of `pnsystem`.  This lets you naturally use such
    constants in expressions like `2œÄ/3` without automatically converting to `Float64`.
 4. Each of a short list of functions given by `unary_funcs` in `utilities/macros.jl` will
    first convert their arguments to the `eltype` of `pnsystem`.  In particular, you can use
    expressions like `‚àö10` or `ln(2)` without the result being converted to a `Float64`.
 5. Insert the `pnsystem` argument as the first argument to each occurrence of
    `@pn_expansion` that needs it.

To be more explicit, the first three are achieved by defining the relevant quantities in a
`let` block placed around the body of `func`, so that the values may be used efficiently
without recomputation.

If you need to use one of the fundamental- or derived-variable functions as arguments of
values other than those encapsulated in `pnsystem`, you'll need to address them explicitly
with the module name ‚Äî as in `PostNewtonian.v(;Œ©, M)`.

"""
    @pn_expansion [[offset] pnsystem] expansion

Gather terms in `expansion` by the powers of `v` involved, the choose on the powers chosen
by the `pnsystem`'s `PNOrder` parameter, and evaluate efficiently in Horner form.

Note that the `pnsystem` argument can be inserted automatically by [`@pn_expression`](@ref).
For simplicity of presentation, we will assume that this is done in the examples below.

A "PN expansion" is a polynomial in ``v`` for which ``ln(v)`` factors may be present in
coefficients of ``v^k`` for ``k‚â•1``.  The input may involve multiple terms with the same
power of ``v``.  (I.e., the expansion does not have to be simplified or
[`collect`](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/simplification.html#collect)ed
in sympy parlance.)

However, note that the sum must appear together ‚Äî as part of the same `:+` expression ‚Äî
rather than, say, factored into two sums that multiply each other.

The `offset` argument represents the *index* of the relative PN order (that is, 2 times the
PN order) at which the PN expansion begins.  So if the first term in the expansion is really
a relative 2.5-pN term, we should use an `offset` of 5.  For example, the
[`tidal_heating`](@ref) expressions for `MÃá‚ÇÅ` and `MÃá‚ÇÇ` begin with a term proportional to
`v^15`, and are added to the flux [`ùìï`](@ref), which begin's with a term proportional to
`v^10`.  This means that `MÃá‚ÇÅ` and `MÃá‚ÇÇ` enter at 2.5-pN relative order, so we use an
`offset` of 5.
