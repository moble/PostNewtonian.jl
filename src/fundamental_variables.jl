    R(pnsystem)

Orientation of the binary, as a `Rotor`.

At any instant, the binary is represented by the right-handed triad ``(n̂, λ̂, ℓ̂)``, where
[``n̂``](@ref PostNewtonian.n̂) is the unit vector pointing from object 2 to object 1, and
the instantaneous velocities of the binary's elements are in the ``n̂``-``λ̂`` plane.  This
`Rotor` will rotate the ``x̂`` vector to be along ``n̂``,  the ``ŷ`` vector to be along
``λ̂``, and  the ``ẑ`` vector to be along ``ℓ̂``.

Note that the angular velocity associated to `R` is given by ``Ω⃗ = 2 Ṙ R̄ = Ω ℓ̂ + ϖ n̂``.
(Any component of ``Ω⃗`` along ``λ̂`` would violate the condition that the velocities be in
the ``n̂``-``λ̂`` plane.)  Here, the scalar quantity ``Ω`` is the orbital angular frequency,
and ``ϖ`` is the precession angular frequency.

See also [`n̂`](@ref PostNewtonian.n̂), [`λ̂`](@ref PostNewtonian.λ̂), [`ℓ̂`](@ref
PostNewtonian.ℓ̂), [`Ω`](@ref PostNewtonian.Ω), and [`𝛡`](@ref PostNewtonian.𝛡)``=ϖ n̂``.

    v(pnsystem)
    v(;Ω, M=1)

Post-Newtonian velocity parameter.  This is related to the orbital angular frequency
``\Omega`` as
```math
v \colonequals (M\,\Omega)^{1/3},
```
where ``M`` is the total mass of the binary.

Note that if you want to pass the value ``Ω`` (rather than a `PNSystem`), you must pass it
as a keyword argument — as in `v(Ω=0.1)`.

    Λ₁(pnsystem)
    Lambda1(pnsystem)

Quadrupolar tidal-coupling parameter of object 1 in this system.

We imagine object 1 begin placed in an (adiabatic) external field with Newtonian potential
``\phi``, resulting in a tidal field measured by ``\partial_i \partial_j \phi`` evaluated at
the center of mass of the object.  This induces a quadrupole moment ``Q_{ij}`` in object 1,
which can be related to the tidal field as
```math
Q_{ij} = -\frac{G^4}{c^{10}} \Lambda_1 M_1^5 \partial_i \partial_j \phi,
```
where ``M_1`` is the mass of object 1.  This tidal-coupling parameter ``\Lambda_1`` can be
related to the Love number ``k_2`` (where the subscript 2 refers to the fact that this is
for the ``\ell=2`` quadrupole, rather than object 2) as
```math
\Lambda_1 = \frac{2}{3} \frac{c^{10}}{G^5} \frac{R_1^5}{M_1^5} k_2,
```
where ``R_1`` is the radius of object 1.  Note that ``\Lambda_1`` is dimensionless.  For
black holes, it is precisely zero; for neutron stars it may range up to 1; more exotic
objects may have significantly larger values.

Note that — as of this writing — only `NSNS` systems can have a nonzero value for this
quantity.  All other types return `0`, which Julia can use to eliminate code that would then
be 0.  Thus, it is safe and efficient to use this quantity in any PN expression that
specializes on the type of `pnsystem`.

this quantity.  All other types return `0`, which Julia can use to eliminate code that would
